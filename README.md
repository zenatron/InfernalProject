## About
2D Dungeon Platformer.
Try to survive hordes of Skeletons as long as you can, using the dungeon layout to your advantage.  
Skeletons will periodically spawn, and will seek you upon sight.  
There is no healing, so you should use dashing and wall jumping to your advantage to avoid dying.

## Controls
Use A/D to move, Space to jump, Shift to dash, and LMB to attack. Use Q to stun enemies in range.

## How to Play
Clone the repository, add the InfernalGame folder as a project in Unity, using version 2022.3.46f1.  
If you use a newer version of Unity, you will need to convert the project, which may cause some things to break.  
After that, build and run the project.
